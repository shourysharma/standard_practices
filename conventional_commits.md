# Conventional Commits Documentation

Conventional Commits is a specification for structuring commit messages in a consistent and readable format. By following this convention, developers can create more descriptive and organized commit histories, making it easier to understand changes in a project and automate certain tasks like versioning and changelog generation. This documentation outlines the steps to write conventional commits:

**Step 1: Install Git**
Ensure you have Git installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest version of Git from the official website for your operating system.

**Step 2: Set Up a Git Repository**
Create or navigate to the Git repository where you want to start using conventional commits. Initialize a new Git repository or use an existing one.

**Step 3: Set Up Commit Message Guidelines**
Define the commit message guidelines for your project. Conventional Commits have a specific format that includes a type, an optional scope, and a subject. For example:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>
```

Types can include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc. Scopes are optional and specify which part of the project is affected.

**Step 4: Make Changes to Your Code**
Start making changes to your codebase. Each commit should represent a logical and atomic change related to a specific task.

**Step 5: Stage Your Changes**
Use `git add` to stage the changes you want to include in your commit.

**Step 6: Write the Commit Message**
Before committing, write a concise and descriptive commit message following the guidelines set in Step 3. Remember to keep the first line under 72 characters.

Example:
```
feat(users): Add user authentication functionality
```

**Step 7: Commit Your Changes**
Commit your changes with the following command:
```
git commit -m "feat(users): Add user authentication functionality"
```

**Step 8: Repeat for Each Change**
Continue making changes to your codebase, staging, and committing them with appropriate commit messages.

**Step 9: Push to Remote Repository**
When ready, push your changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

**Step 10: Use Conventional Commits Tools**
Optionally, you can use various tools that support conventional commits, such as commit message linters, commitizen, and commitlint, to ensure compliance and provide interactive prompts for generating commit messages.

**Step 11: Automate with CI/CD Pipelines**
Leverage Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate tasks like running tests, generating changelogs, or versioning based on conventional commit messages.

**Step 12: Follow Community Conventions**
If you're contributing to an open-source project, check if they have their own conventions for conventional commits. Adhering to the project's established guidelines will make your contributions consistent with the rest of the codebase.

By following these steps and writing conventional commits consistently, you can improve the quality and maintainability of your codebase and collaborate more effectively with other developers.
