# Conventional Issues Documentation

Writing conventional GitHub issues is essential for effective project management, collaboration, and issue tracking. Conventional issues follow a standardized format, providing clear and concise information to developers, contributors, and maintainers. This documentation outlines the steps to write conventional issues in GitHub:

**Step 1: Navigate to the Repository**
Go to the GitHub repository where you want to create the issue. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to add issues to this repository.

**Step 2: Click on the "Issues" Tab**
In the repository's menu, click on the "Issues" tab. This will take you to the issues section of the repository.

**Step 3: Search for Existing Issues**
Before creating a new issue, check if a similar issue already exists. Look through the open and closed issues to see if the problem has been addressed before. If you find a similar issue, consider adding any additional relevant information as a comment on that existing issue instead of creating a duplicate.

**Step 4: Click on "New Issue"**
If you don't find an existing issue that matches your problem or request, click on the "New issue" button to create a new one.

**Step 5: Write a Descriptive Title**
Write a clear and descriptive title for the issue. The title should briefly summarize the problem or feature request so that others can quickly understand the issue's content.

**Step 6: Provide a Detailed Description**
In the description field, provide a thorough explanation of the issue. Include the following elements:

- **Issue Type**: Clearly specify whether it's a bug report, feature request, enhancement, or any other type.

- **Steps to Reproduce**: If it's a bug, provide step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the issue. For a feature request or enhancement, describe the desired functionality in detail.

- **Expected Behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen (for bug reports) or what you would like to see implemented (for feature requests).

- **Actual Behavior**: If reporting a bug, explain what is currently happening instead of the expected behavior.

- **Context**: Include any relevant information about the environment, operating system, browser (if applicable), and any other factors that might be affecting the issue.

- **Screenshots or Code Snippets**: If applicable, add screenshots or code snippets to help illustrate the problem.

**Step 7: Use Labels and Assignees**
Labels help categorize issues and can be used for bug tracking, feature requests, and more. Choose appropriate labels to classify the issue. Additionally, you can assign the issue to specific team members responsible for addressing it.

**Step 8: Mention Related Issues**
If the issue is related to any other GitHub issues, mention them in the description using the syntax `#issue-number`.

**Step 9: Preview and Submit the Issue**
Before submitting the issue, use the "Preview" tab to review how the issue will look. Ensure all the information is accurate and complete.

**Step 10: Follow Up on the Issue**
After submitting the issue, keep an eye on it for any comments, updates, or requests for further information. Be responsive and cooperative in the issue discussion.

**Step 11: Close the Issue**
Once the issue is resolved, the assigned developer or maintainer should close the issue. Closing the issue indicates that the problem has been addressed or the feature has been implemented.

**Step 12: Referencing Issues in Commits**
Developers can reference GitHub issues in their commit messages using the syntax `#issue-number`. This helps establish a connection between the commit and the issue, providing better traceability.

By following these steps and writing conventional GitHub issues consistently, you contribute to a more organized and collaborative development process. Well-structured issues help developers and maintainers better understand, prioritize, and address problems or feature requests effectively.
